          <h2 class="display-5">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
          <p class="lead">Q: What are Terpenes and Cannabinoids, and why should I care? </p>
          <p>A: Terpenes are naturally occuring aeromatic compounds, Cannabinoids are the functional components of the Cannabis plant, together they produce the 'entourage effect' which increases the efficacy of the individual compounds. By blending Terpenes and Cannabinoids individually we are able to isolate individual aspects of the base plant and optimize accordingly, without the inclusion of THC (the main psychoactive component of Cannabis).</p>

          <p class="lead">Q: This seems sketchy, is it legal? </p>
          <p>A: As of July 1 2018 CBD has been descheduled federally in the US, meaning that CBD products are good to go as long as they have been lab tested to verify zero THC content. All of our products comply with this designation and can be sold and shipped within the US to customers 21 years and older.</p>
